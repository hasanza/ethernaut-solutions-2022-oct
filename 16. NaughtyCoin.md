# Ethernaut Level 16 (Naughty Coin) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 16. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here was to be aware of the functionality of imported, 3rd party contracts. If there are any functions one does not need, override them and neuter them by simply putting a revert in the body.

#### Solution

Since the only the `transfer` function from the ERC20 contract was overridden, `approve` and `transferFrom` were still there to be used. Thus, I approved the player himself to use all the funds (INITIAL_SUPPLY), after that I used `transferFrom` to transfer the tokens to another address, thereby depleting the entire token balance for `player`.
