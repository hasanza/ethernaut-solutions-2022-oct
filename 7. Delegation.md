# Ethernaut Level 7 (Delegation) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 7. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is to understand the nature of delegate calls and the associated risk when incorporating them into code.

A delegate call is one whereby the call is made to one contract, but the state is changed of another (i.e., the contract to which the delegate call is made inside the immediately called contract.).

The syntax/ code for making a delegate call to another contract using the function selector:

```
(bool success, bytes memory data) = OtherContract.delegatecall
(abi.encodeWithSelector
(OtherContract.func1.selector, arg1, arg2));
```

The syntax/ code for making a delegate call to another contract using the function signature:

```
(bool success, bytes memory data) = OtherContract.delegatecall
(abi.encodeWithSignature
("function(arg1Type, arg2Type)", arg1, arg2));
```

#### Solution

First, we have to calculate the selector for the pwn() function.

`const selector = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("pwn()")`

Second, we have to make the call to Delegation, but call `pwn()` as its function. This way, the fallback function is triggered, which then makes the delegate call to the function whose selector is in msg.data of the transaction. Thus, `pwn()` function of Delegate contract is called.

To make the call, we simply use sendTransaction like:

`await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: contract.address, data: selector})`
