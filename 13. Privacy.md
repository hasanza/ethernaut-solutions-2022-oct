# Ethernaut Level 13 (Privacy) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 13. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is to not consider anything stored on-chain as private, or obscured from anyone.

#### Solution

The solution involved learning more about EVM storage quirks, types and sizes. First, need to figure out which storage slot does the key live in. The key was the bytes32 value at the index 2 of the data array. We can count the slots used by the declared variables, considering their data types along the way. Once we identified the slot (in this case 5), we get the value stored there using `web3.getStorageAt(address, slot)`.

The password however is in bytes16, so we have to typecast this bytes32 value into bytes16. We can use this simple smart contract which typecasts this value into bytes16.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

contract Converter {
    constructor() {}

    function castTo16(bytes32 value) pure public returns (bytes16) {
        return bytes16(value);
    }
}
```

Note that when typecasting from larger bytes to smaller, the rightmost bytes are truncated/ lost. Similarly, 0s are appended on the right when you cast to a larger type.
