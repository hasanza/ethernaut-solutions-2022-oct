### 6\. Tokens

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 6. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is to always be wary of and check for integer under/over flows in Solidity. Usually SafeMath library by OZ is best used for this, but now this functionality is built into solidity since its 0.8.0 release.

#### Solution

With the aim being to get additional tokens somehow, the solution is to call the transfer function with a value more than the balance of the player. This way, when the the amount is deducted to reflect the new, post transfer balance, the value goes below zero and starts from the largest possible uint value. Go ahead and do this in the Ethernaut console.
