# Ethernaut Level 9 (Vault) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 9. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is that private variables are still publicly accessible, it's just that other contracts cannot access them. Thus, sensitive information should not be stored on the blockchain. If there is a need to do so, it should be encrypted.

#### Solution

The solution was to access the storage slot of the `password` variable. All variables of a contract are stored in Storage Slots inside the EVM. The EVM storage is a large array of 2^256 slots, with each slot having a max capacity of 32 bytes (256 bits). Furthermore, all variables are given storage in the sequence that they are declared.

Perhaps a bit more overview of smart contract storage would be helpful here.

A uint256 type variable is 32 bytes and thus takes an entire slot, while a uint16 takes 2 bytes (8 + 8 = 16 bits = 2 bytes), a bool takes 1 byte while an address takes 20 bytes. EVM tries to utilize all space in a slot so tries to store the next declared variable in left over space in a slot (starting from the right). E.g., if a slot has an address, 32 - 20 = 12 bytes still remain, and so if the next value can fit in (e.g., a bool), it will be stored in this slot alongside the address (in the empty bytes on its left).

For a fixed sized array of uints, the elements will be stored in sequential slots e.g., slot 2, 3, 4.

For a dynamic array of struct Student {uint id, bytes32 password}, the array length will be stored at slot 5, while the elements will be stored sequentially at the keccak hash of the slot (keccak(5)) where the array length was stored. Thus, the first struct will be stored at keccak(5), the second at keccak(5 + 2) (because each user struct takes 2 slots, one for id and one for password), the third at keccak(5+4) and so on.

For mappings, the values are stored at the hash of the key and the slot. E.g., for the mapping (uint => Student) private idToStudent, the first Student struct will be stored at keccak(0,7) (since 7 is the next available slot). For the second student it will be at keccak(1,7), and so on.

Thus, `web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address,slot)` can be used to get to the appropriate storage-slot and retrieve the password.
