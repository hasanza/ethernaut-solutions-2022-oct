# Ethernaut Level 19 (Magic Number) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 19. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

#### Preliminary Understanding

At the outset, an overview of smart contract creation process is presented.

The EVM only understands hexadecimal bytecode. The solidity compiler converts the contract source code into bytecode. The bytecode represents the EVM operation codes in hexadecimal base which the EVM understands and executes. Since the EVM is a stack machine, the opcodes are stacked and then executed in LIFO order. This execution pattern is called Reverse Polish Notation. E.g., 2 2 + 10 x will give 40.

Each machine/ hexadecimal opcode has a mnemonic equivalent as well. E.g., `0x01` is ADD, `0x00` is STOP, `0x60` is PUSH1 (pushes 1-byte item to the stack.).

`PUSH1 0x60` means push 1 byte containing data `0x60` onto the stack. Since PUSH1 is itself also denoted by `0x60`

Consider the following example:

`PUSH1 0x60 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE`

To understand this instruction, remember that opcodes follow Reverse Polish Notation (see above). With this in mind, let's consider this instruction.

`PUSH1 0x60` means "place 1 byte item (in this case 0x60, 96 in decimal) on the stack". Note that the `PUSH1 or 0x60` opcode takes no arguments, but produces 1 output, which is the value stored on the stack. The EVM reads this opcode and places the raw byte value `0x60` following it onto the stack.
Following this, `PUSH1 0x40` places the raw byte value `0x40 (64 in decimal)` onto the stack. The stack now looks like:

| Stack |
| --- |
| `0x40` |
| `0x60` |

Finally, we have the opcode `MSTORE` which stores items on the stack into memory, and takes 2 arguments (first argument being the amount of space to allocate, and the second argument being the place in memory to which the resting pointer is moved - for each arg, the stacked is popped LIFO-style) but produces no output.
In this case, it takes the two items on the stack `0x40` and `0x60` respectively. `0x40` will be used as the memory address, and `0x60` is the value that will be stored there. We thus have 64 bytes for scratch space and 32 bytes for temporary memory storage.

Since 0x can be omitted as EVM treats all inputs as hexadecimal, this instruction can be written as:
`6060604052`

Having understood how EVM machine instructions are written and executed, contract execution code will now be looked at in detail.

Contract creation bytecode contains **Initialization Code** and **Runtime Code**, both sets of opcodes concatenated sequentially. It is set as the data field of the contract creation transaction.
Once this transaction is received by the EVM, it loads the initialization opcode onto the stack executes it (the constructor is also executed during this) and keeps executing the opcodes on the stack until the first `STOP` or `RETURN` opcode is reached. After this, only the runtime code remains on the stack.
Thereafter, the runtime code is copied into the memory (using MSTORE) and returned to the EVM, which then finally stores this code into the storage against the associated address. It is this stack of opcodes that is executed when calls are made to this contract.

MSTORE stores the stack items into memory thereby freeing up the stack. MLOAD loads from memory.

In this problem, the it is the runtime code that can only have 10 opcodes and return `0x42` . This brings us to the `RETURN or oxf3` opcode which takes two arguments (1: address of data to return and 2: size in bytes of the data to be returned). EVM memory addresses start like `0x0, 0x10, 0x20 ...`

#### Lesson

The lesson here was grand; understand the EVM and contract creation at a deeper level and know that using assembly, while dangerous, can save space and be more felxible than solidity.

#### Solution

##### Part 1

The solution is to write 10 bytes of Runtime Opcodes which store and return `42` (0x2a in hex). This can be written as:

```
PUSH1 2a // the value to return, 42.
PUSH1 40 // the location in memory to store value at, arbitrary
// The stack now has 0x40 on top and 0x2a on the bottom
MSTORE(location - 0x40, item 0x20) // stores item at location (last two items in stack in LIFO order)
// Now, to return the stored value. 
//Return takes two args, 1: location, 2: size. Lets put these two args on the stack so RETURN can use them
// 0x40, 0x20 = Return the 0x20 (32) bytes stored starting at location 0x40
// This returns 0x2a or 42
PUSH1 20
PUSH1 40
RETURN
```

Concatenated together and converted to bytecode, these opcodes become: `602a60405260206040f3`.
We treat the return value as a uint256 (entire storage slot), so make the size 32 bytes, 0x20 in hex.
Thus, our runtime code is ready. Now, we turn to writing the initialization code.

##### Part 2

The Initialization Code will copy the runtime code and return it to the EVM, which will then store it in the storage.

`COPYCODE - 0x39` is used to copy over the runtime code as received in transaction to the EVM memory. It takes 3 args:

1.  1.  `destOffset`: byte offset in the memory where the result will be copied.
    2.  `offset`: byte offset in the code to copy.
    3.  `size`: byte size to copy.

Now, we know the size of the runtime byte code from part 1, its `10 bytes` so `0x0a` in hex will be the size. We can make `0x00` the destination address. However, since the runtime code comes after the initialization code, we do not yet know where init code ends and it starts. So, we first write the initialization code, at first leaving arg 2 (destOffset) empty.

```
PUSH1 0a // size of code to copy (10 bytes)
PUSH1 -- // Destination offset (yet unknown)
PUSH1 00 // Location in memory to copy over, (0x00) 
CODECOPY
// Now, to return the copied code to the EVM
PUSH1 0a // size of runtime code
PUSH1 00 // location of runtime code
RETURN
```

These opcodes have the bytecode equivalent:
`600a60--600039600a6000f3`
The total length of the init code is thus 11 bytes (starting from 0). The runtime code will start after the 12th slot and so, we know it's location to be `0x0c`. We replace -- with 0c and finally have the init code:

`600a600c600039600a6000f3` 

Now, we just concatenate and send the resulting bytecode in a transaction instantiating our contract.

init code (`600a600c600039600a6000f3` ) \+ runtime code(`602a60405260206040f3`) = `600a600c600039600a6000f3602a60405260206040f3`. After the 12th byte (0xf3), the runtime code starts. It is this code that will be copied to memory. The init code simply performs the operation of copying the runtime code of 10 bytes which starts at 0x00 in the calldata, to the memory at the location starting at 0x0c.

`txReceipt = await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, data: '600a600c600039600a6000f3602a60405260206040f3'})`

Then, we get the contract address from the transaction receipt:

`addr = txReceipt.contractAddress`

Finally, we set the address in the target contract and submit the instance:

`await contract.setSolver(addr)`
