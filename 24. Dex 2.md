# Ethernaut Level 24 (Dex2) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 24. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

Dex 2 is a modification of Dex 1; it has been modified in one crucial way: Inside Dex2.swap(), the check to ensure that the tokens being swapped are token 1 and token 2 only is removed.

Tho recap, when we swap token A for token B, the amount that we will receive after the swap in a contract product DEX is as follows:

PostSwapTokenBAmount = (TokenAAmountBeingSwapped * TotalTokenBBalanceInPool) / TotalTokenABalanceInPool

We are multiplying first to preserve more precision as in case of a fractional result, Solidity rounds down toward 0 by default.

#### Solution

We use the loophole of using any token as the *from* token; we can deploy another ERC20 token with a huge supply, then swap that, first for all of token A in the DEX and then all of token B.

First, we deploy our own token and mint 200 tokens to us. Second, we send 100 tokens to the target contract becuase the swap price is determined by this function:

```
  function getSwapAmount(address from, address to, uint amount) public view returns(uint){
    return((amount * IERC20(to).balanceOf(address(this)))/IERC20(from).balanceOf(address(this)));
  }
```

which checks the `from` token balance held by the target account to calculate the swap price.

Now, the Dex has 100 of our token, and 100 of both token1 and token2 which we want to drain. This makes their swap ratio 1:1. Here, we will use the loophole mentioned above and swap 100 of our token for 100 of tokenA:

`await contract.swap(myToken, token1, "100")`

We have now drained all of token 1. Now, the target contract has 200 of our tokens (100 we deposited initially and 100 as a result of our last swap). As a result, now we want to swap 200 of our tokens (all of it in the target contract) with 100 of tokenB.

`await contract.swap(myToken, token2, "200")`

Thus, we have drained both tokens from the Dex and achieved our goal.
