# Ethernaut Level 12 (Elevator) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 12. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here was to be careful when making external calls and relying on them for critical logic. In particular, to only call external functions what have the `view` or `pure` modifiers to be sure that they do not modify state.

#### Solution

The solution involved writing a Building contract, which returned a different bool value each time it was called. A counter was used to return false value at first, and then a true value so that the top variable in the Elevator contract was set to true. Essentially, a sort of toggle variable is needed, whose value is changed between calls, is needed to crack this level.

      count++;
      if (count % 2 == 0) {return true;}
        return false;
  }

  function attack(uint8 _floor) public {
      elevatorInstance.goTo(_floor);
  }

  function destroy() public {
      selfdestruct(payable(0xecA5bA71FC055AF7FCdFb5755C575B67Ac48EcDF));
  }

  receive() external payable {}
