# Ethernaut Level 23 (Dex1) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 23. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is two fold:

1.  swap prices on a [constant product](https://research.paradigm.xyz/amm-price-impact) dex are influenced by factors such as liqudity, trade size etc. If a trade is big enough and/or the liquidity is low enough, the price can be dramatically affected, and you will get a lesser amount for a swap than you otherwise in normal conditions.
2.  It is not wise to fetch swap prices from a single dex, since due to factors mentioned in the previous point, the prices can be influenced. As such, it is more prudent to fetch the price from multiple dexes and aggregate them; for this Chainlink price feeds can be used which already do this.

#### Solution

In summary, the solution is to keep swapping all of one token you have, to and fro, until nothing remains of the other token in the dex. This is because with each trade, the swap price is influenced and one token keeps becoming cheaper in terms of the other. Let's understand the process now.

First, we will approve the DEX contract to use the player's token1 and token2 funds, we will approve a large amount (e.g., 1000) so we only approve once. Now, the level states that this can be done by calling `contract.approve(spender, amount)` and we can approve the contract to spend `amount` of both tokens. However, since this function has two approvals side by side, Metamask just keeps on loading (possibly due to a bug) and does not show the transaction conformation screen. My work around for this was to call`IERC20.approve(owner, spender, amount)`for both tokens separately.

To do this, construct an encoded function call calling the token.approve() function with the required parameters.

```
callStr = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
    name: 'approve',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [{
        type: 'address',
        name: 'owner'
    },{
        type: 'address',
        name: 'spender'
    },{
        type: 'uint256',
        name: 'amount'
    }]
}, [player, contract.address, 1000]);
```

Then, call the token1's approve function with callStr as the value for `data` field of the transaction
`await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: token1, data: callStr})`
Token2
`await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: token2, data: callStr})`
Now, the contract is allowed to spend 1000 tokens belonging to the player.

The next step is to start swapping to influence the swap price given the very low liquidity of the pool and how much we proportionally possess. The pool has 100 of both token A and token B while we have 10 of each, so we have 10% of the entire liquidity for a token!

0.  **Initial Balance: Player: 10A, 10B - Pool: 100A, 100B. SwapPrice: 1A:1B**
1.  **Swap 10A. We have 0A and 20B. Pool has 110A and 90B**. Now, there is less token B and more token A which means we can buy more tokenA for the same token B. Wwe will now swap all of our tokenB (20) to token A.
2.  Swap 20B. We have 24A and 0B. Pool has 86A and 110B.
3.  Swap 24A. We have 0A and 30B. Pool has 110A and 80B.
4.  Swap 30B. We have 41A and 0B. Pool has 69A and 110B.
5.  Swap 41A. We have 0A and 65B. Pool has 110A and 45B.
    At this point, if we swap all of our Token B (65), the resulting amount will exceed the amount of tokenA available in the pool (110).

65B * TotalA(110)/TotalB(45) = 158A,

which exceeds what the pool has by 52 tokens. Since we want to completely drain the liquidity of one token (in this case tokenA) from the pool, we first calculate exactly how much of tokenB do we need to swap for the resulting tokenA amount to be exactly 110.

AmountBToSwap * 110A/45B = 110A (we do some algebra, and get)
AmountBToSwap = 45.

We can see that this is equal to the amount of tokenB the pool has. So, next time just swap an amount equal to the total amount of tokenB to empty out tokenA.

6.  Swap 45B. We have 110A and 20B. Pool has 0A and 90B.

And thus, we have drained all tokenA from the pool.
