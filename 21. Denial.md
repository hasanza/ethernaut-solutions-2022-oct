# Ethernaut Level 21 (Denial) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 21. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is to be careful when interacting with unknown contracts, even when just sending ETH to an address, in the course of an execution. And further, set a gas value in `call`s made to other contracts, and to always employ the **checks-effects-interactions** pattern. That is, in an execution, first check for requisite conditions, then make changes to state of the current contract and finally to interact with external contract(s).

In this case, one of the error methods, `assert` does not return gas forwarded to it in a `call`, unlike its nicer siblings `require` and `revert`.

#### Solution

The solution is simply to write and deploy a contract that triggers a failing assert when sent ETH. Then, set this contract's address as the `partner` address. This will make the call revert when owner calls `withdraw` and all the gas is usurped by the `assert` in our contract.

pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;

contract Denier {
  // Will revert upon receiving funds
  // Will not refund gas
  fallback() external payable{
    assert(false);
  }
}
```
