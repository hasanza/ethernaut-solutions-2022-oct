# Ethernaut Level 20 (Alien Codex) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 19. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is that the EVM doesn't validate an array's ABI-encoded length vs its actual payload.Â 

If a dynamic array's length is forced into an underflow (length is 0 and we deduct 1 from it), it becomes 2^256 and thus we have access to the entire contract storage through that array (Arithmetic underflow of array length). We then just have to figure out where each variable lies. This is easy enough if the variable is at the extremities (at the very start slot 0 or the last slot), in this case at slot 0; we just need to overwrite slot 0.

#### Solution

First, we `makeContact` with the contract. Then, we `retract` making the `codex` array's length `2^256` giving us access to the entire contract storage. Then, we need to overwrite slot 0 (owner) via the elongated `codex` array.

For Dynamic arrays, the array length is stored at the next available slot (in this case slot 1, the `contact` bool is stored beside owner in slot 0), which the array items are stored at keccak hash of the slot number concatenated with item index. E.g., `keccak256(0x000...1 <concat> n)` for slot number n.

Hashing the slot number `1` will give us the memory location from where the `codex` array storage starts, slot 0 for codex array.

`web3.utils.keccak256('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001')` Since we want the first slot of the `codex` array, no need to concatenate slot number (in this case 0).

We are now at slot 0 of the `codex` array. However, we want to get to the slot 0 for the entire contract storage. To do this, we deduct this slot from 2^256, the number of total slots, casting them both to bigInts.

`firstIndex = BigInt(2 ** 256) - BigInt(p)`

This gives us the index where owner is stored. That is, slot 0 of the contract storage.

Now, we just concatenate 12 zeroes preceded by `0x` to our address (since a slot is 32 bytes long while the address is 20 bytes only) and call `contract.revise(firstIndex, zeroPaddedPlayerAddress)`.
